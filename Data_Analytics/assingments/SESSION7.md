1. Create a table called Orders with columns: order_id, user_name, total_amount, and order_date. Insert 5 sample rows with different users and order amounts, including at least one NULL value for total_amount.
 
 ***

 CREATE TABLE orders (
 order_id int PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
 user_name varchar(255),
 total_amount int,
 orderd_date date
 )


 ***


2. Write a SQL query to count how many orders were placed by each user in the Orders table, displaying user_name and the number of orders as order_count.
 

 ***

 SELECT user_name,
       COUNT(*) AS order_count
 FROM Orders
 GROUP BY user_name

 ***


3. Write a SQL query to calculate the average total_amount of all orders in the Orders table, making sure to ignore any NULL values.
 

 ***


 SELECT AVG(total_amount)FROM Orders


 ***


4. Suppose you are building a Flipkart-style dashboard: Write a SQL query to find the highest and lowest order amounts (MAX and MIN) from the Orders table, and display both values in a single result row.


  ***


  SELECT MAX(total_amount) as max_amount,MIN(total_amount) as min_amount FROM orders


  ***


5. Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (SUM of total_amount) for all orders, but only include orders where total_amount is not NULL. Use a WHERE clause to filter out NULL values before applying the SUM function.

  ***

  SELECT SUM(total_amount) FROM orders WHERE total_amount is not null

  ***
