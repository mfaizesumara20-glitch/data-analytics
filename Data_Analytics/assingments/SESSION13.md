1.Create a table named Playlists with columns: id, user_id, playlist_name, and total_likes. Insert at least 8 sample rows with different users and playlists, making sure some playlists have the same user_id.
 
   ***
      CREATE TABLE Playlists (pid int PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,users_id int,playlist_name varchar(255),total_likes int)

   ***






2.Write a SQL query using ROW_NUMBER() and the OVER() clause to assign a unique row number to each playlist, ordered by total_likes in descending order.


  ***

    SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY total_likes DESC),
       playlist_name
FROM Playlists;
 
  ***






3.Use the RANK() function with the OVER() clause to rank all playlists by total_likes, and display the playlist_name, user_id, total_likes, and their rank.


 ***

SELECT playlist_name,
       users_id,
       total_likes,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_likes DESC) AS playlist_rank
FROM Playlists;


  ***






4.Write a SQL query using DENSE_RANK() and PARTITION BY user_id to rank each user's playlists by total_likes, showing playlist_name, user_id, total_likes, and dense rank.

   ***

    SELECT playlist_name,
       users_id,
       total_likes,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (
           PARTITION BY users_id
           ORDER BY total_likes DESC
       ) AS dense_rank
FROM Playlists;


   ***








5.Imagine you want to show the top 2 playlists per user based on total_likes, like Spotify's 'Your Top Playlists' feature. Write a query using a window function to select only the top 2 playlists for each user.

 ***

  SELECT playlist_name,
       user_id,
       total_likes
FROM
(
    SELECT playlist_name,
           user_id,
           total_likes,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
               PARTITION BY user_id
               ORDER BY total_likes DESC
           ) AS rn
    FROM Playlists
) AS ranked_playlists
WHERE rn <= 2;
