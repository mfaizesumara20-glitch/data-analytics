1. Create a table named MusicPlaylist with columns: id, song_name, artist, genre, and duration. Insert at least 5 records representing songs from your favorite Spotify playlist, then write a SELECT statement to retrieve all columns for all songs.
 
 # table 
 ***

 CREATE TABLE MusicPlaylist (
 mid int PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
 song_name varchar(255),
 artist varchar(255),
 genre varchar(255),
  duration time 
 )

 ***

# SELECT statement to retrieve all columns for all songs.

 ***

 SELECT * FROM music_playlist

 ***

2. Write a SQL query to display only the song_name and artist columns from the MusicPlaylist table, showing just the first 3 records using the LIMIT keyword.

 ***

 SELECT song_name,artist FROM music_playlist LIMIT 0,3;


 ***

 3. Suppose you have a table named FoodOrders with columns: id, restaurant, food_item, and order_date. Write a SQL query to list all unique restaurant names where you have placed orders, using the DISTINCT keyword.
 

 ***

 SELECT DISTINCT ('restaurant') FROM FoodOrders

 ***

4. Write a SQL query on the FoodOrders table to select food_item as 'Dish' and order_date as 'Date Ordered', displaying only these two columns with the column aliases in the output.
 

 ***

 SELECT food_item AS 'dish', order_date as 'Date Ordered' from FoodOrders 


 ***


 5. 
You tried running this query: SELECT DISTINCT food_item, restaurant FROM FoodOrders LIMIT 2, but it returns an error or doesn't work as expected. Identify and fix the mistake in the query
 
 ***

you need to have 2 numbers in the limit to run this query propely
