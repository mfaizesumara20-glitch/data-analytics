1. Create a table called Restaurants with columns: id, name, cuisine, rating, and city. Insert at least 5 sample records representing real or fictional restaurants you might find on Zomato.

 
 ***

 CREATE TABLE Restaurants (
 rid int PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
 name varchar(255),
 cuisine varchar(255),
 rating ENUM ('1 star','2 star','3 star','4 star','5 star'),
 city varchar(255)
 )


 ***


2. Write a SQL query to find all restaurants in the Restaurants table that have a rating greater than 4.0 and are located in either 'Ahmedabad' or 'Surat'.


  ***

   SELECT *
 FROM Restaurants
 WHERE rating > 4
 AND city LIKE 'A%';
 

 ***


3. Using the LIKE operator, write a query to select all restaurants whose names start with 'Swa' (for example, 'Swagat', 'Swadisht') from the Restaurants table.

 ***

 SELECT * FROM restaurants WHERE name LIKE 'sWA%'

 ***


4. Write a SQL query using the BETWEEN keyword to find all restaurants in the Restaurants table with a rating between 3.5 and 4.5 (inclusive).

 
 ***

 SELECT * FROM restaurants WHERE rating BETWEEN 3 AND 4 


 ***

5. Write a query to find all restaurants whose cuisine is either 'Chinese', 'Italian', or 'South Indian' using the IN operator.
 

 ***

 SELECT * FROM restaurants WHERE cuisine in ('Chinese','Italian','South Indian')
