1.Create a SQL query using a subquery in the WHERE clause to find all restaurants from a 'Restaurants' table whose average rating is higher than the average rating of all restaurants in the city.   


***
   SELECT *
FROM Restaurants
WHERE rating >
(
    SELECT AVG(rating)
    FROM Restaurants
);

***
 



2.Write a SQL query that uses a subquery in the SELECT statement to display each user's name from a 'Users' table along with the total number of orders they have placed from an 'Orders' table, like a summary you might see in a Zomato user profile.   


***

  SELECT name,
       (SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM Orders
        WHERE Orders.user_id = Users.id) AS total_orders
FROM Users;


***




3.Given a 'Movies' table and a 'Reviews' table, write a SQL query using IN with a subquery to list all movies that have at least one review with a rating of 5 stars, as seen in BookMyShow's top-rated section.   


*** 
   SELECT *
FROM Movies
WHERE movie_id IN
(
    SELECT movie_id
    FROM Reviews
    WHERE rating = 5
);

 ***






4.Write a nested SQL query to find the names of all sellers from a 'Sellers' table on a Flipkart-style platform who have sold products in every category listed in a 'Categories' table. Use nested subqueries to compare seller's categories with the complete list of categories.
