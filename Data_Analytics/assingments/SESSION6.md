1. Write an SQL query to display all products from a 'products' table and sort them by price in ascending order, similar to how Flipkart lists items from lowest to highest price.
 
 ***

 SELECT *
 FROM product
 ORDER BY (price) ASC


 ***


2. Modify your previous query to show the top 5 most expensive products using ORDER BY with DESC and LIMIT.
 

 ***
  
  SELECT *
 FROM product
 ORDER BY price DESC
 LIMIT 5;

 ***


3. Given a 'movies' table with columns 'title', 'release_year', and 'rating', write an SQL query to list all movies sorted first by release_year in descending order (latest first), then by rating in descending order (highest rated first).\

 # table
  ***
  
  CREATE TABLE movies(
 mid int PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
 title varchar(255),
 release_date date,
 rating ENUM('1 star','2 star','3 star','4 star','5 star')
 )
 
 ***



 # sorted by release_year
  
  ***
   
   SELECT * FROM movies order BY release_year DESC
   
  ***

 # sorted by rating

  ***
 
 SELECT * FROM movies order BY rating DESC 

  *** 

4. Write an SQL query to display the first 10 restaurants from a 'restaurants' table, sorted alphabetically by name, just like Zomato's A-Z listing.
 
 ***
  
  SELECT * FROM restaurants ORDER BY name ASC LIMIT 0,10;

 ***
